# Weather App

A simple weather app built with React and Node.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
npm install
cd client
npm install


Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory and add your Google Weather API key:

GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_KEY=<YOUR_GOOGLE_WEATHER_API_KEY>


Then start the development server:

npm run dev


This will start the Node app with nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code.

To start the React app, open a new terminal window and run:

npm run client


This will change the directory to `client/` and start the React app in development mode.
